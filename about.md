# About

G'day everyone. My name is Michael, however I'm better known by my nickname 'bigred'. I decided to create a 'blog' this year, because I'm bored shit-less in the middle of a Panedmic . . . and what's the shittest thing you can do to kill time? Blog. I mean, sure, vlogging is probaly more lame but I'm not game enough to buy a selfie stick and walk around looking like a dick all day.
