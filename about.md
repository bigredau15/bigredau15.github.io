# About

G'day everyone. My name is Michael, however I'm better known by my nickname 'bigred'. I decided to create a 'blog' this year, because I'm bored shit-less in the middle of a Pandemic . . . and what's the shittest thing you can do to kill time? Blog. I mean, sure, vlogging is probaly more lame but I'm not game enough to buy a selfie stick and walk around looking like a dick all day - well, no more than usual anyway.  


As you can probably tell by my iniital greeting, I'm Australian, and live in the beautiful city of Melbourne. I am happily married with two young kids! The blog is probably going to be a mix of what I do on a weekly basis, whether that's at work (I.T consultant), or what I do in my personal life, which is mostly lounging around on the couch watching sport these days.  


Cheers,  


bigred
