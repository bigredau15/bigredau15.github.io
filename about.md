# About

G'day everyone. My name is Michael, nick-name 'bigred'. I've been involved in the I.T industry since 2006, as a field engineer, team leader, manager and as a consultant. My areas of expertise is around Linux, AIX, Storage and IBM POWER infrastructure. I'm not exactly great with words, so that's why I've created a blog to demonstrate that exact failure of mine. Outside of I.T, my interests lie mostly within the world of sport, including but not limited to Motorsport (F1, V8, MotoGP), Aussie Rules Football and Cricket. I don't get outside the house much these days, but that's probably because there's a bloody pandemic at the moment.
