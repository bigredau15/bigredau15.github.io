# Spectrum Protect Shell Scripts

**G'dau**, this is the first of many blog posts on this site. This particular post is to publically show some scripts that I've created over the years to assist in automating the day to day tasks of managing IBM Spectrum Protect (formerly known as Tivoli Storage Manager & ADSM). The scripts can be seen at the following github repository at: [github-spectrum_protect](https://github.com/bigredau15/scripts/tree/master/spectrum_protect "spectrum_protect")
